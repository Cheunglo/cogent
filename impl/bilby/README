How to compile BilbyFs?

# Tested with linux-3.18.22. Similar version should work.

Linux:

1 Download linux sources from <https://www.kernel.org/> and decompress it, then `cd` to the target folder

2 run `make menuconfig` and add MTD, UBI, etc as modules.

3 run `make prepare && make modules_prepare` in the linux sources directory

4 run `export KERNELDIR=path/of/linux/sources`

5 run `make` either in the c/ directory to build bilbyfs.ko,
  or in the cogent/ directory to build cgbilbyfs.ko.
