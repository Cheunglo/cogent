* length, crc32 functions: can we compute statically?
* deser arrays
* extend ddsl expressions to cogent expression?
* cannot construct an enum of different but compatible type using {_, ..} syntax 
* change `instance t' to `this' keyword

* constant names are still a problem. can we just do as in cogent to use uppercases?
* constraints are asserted while ser'ing, but checked while deser'ing.
* generate a length function for each data structure from DDSL
